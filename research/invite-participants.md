`[Subject heading]` Invitation to paid-for research for University of Sheffield / Research community because we want to know how to help you better when you are publishing your research outputs

Hello (first name),

My name is (your name) and I’m a user researcher/work for Paper. Many thanks for registering your interest in (what your research is about).

The research sessions will take (how long your sessions will take). We will show/ask you (brief description of what things your research session will include. I.e. asking them questions, get them to work their way through a service.). The research will take place (tell them if it's via video call or if in-person - where) and you will need (what equipment they will need e.g. a device with a camera and a wifi connection).

A few things to note about this research session:



* You’re not being tested, and there are no right or wrong answers
* If there’s a question that you’d rather not answer, we’ll just move on to the next one
* You can stop the session at any time
* Information about how we keep your data safe and secure is in the consent form linked below

There are three things to do:

1. Schedule your interview

Please use this link [insert calendly link]. If the days/times that you are available aren't listed, please let us know and we can try to arrange something that works for you.

Please don’t share this booking link with anyone else - it’s only for people that we specifically invite to do research with us.

2. Your consent form

Before every session we ask participants to fill out a consent form to take part in our research. If you have time before the session, you can fill it out here: [insert consent form link] If you don't have time, or if you'd prefer, we can talk through it at the start of your session.

3. £XX voucher to thank you for your time

We pay an incentive of £X for your participation in the research. This will be in the form of an online voucher for a shop of your choice. You can choose that now using this link: [Insert incentive form link] or after the session. We won't pay the incentive until after you've attended the session.

Your interview will be with [name], who is a user researcher working on behalf of [client name] alongside [name] who will be observing the session to take notes.

If there’s anything that we may be able to do to make the session more comfortable for you, or if you have any questions beforehand, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your time,

Kind regards,

[Your name]


## When you might use this pattern

This pattern should be used when you are contacting someone who has already registered their interested in taking part in your research via a screener, and you wish to invite them to interview based on their screener answers.

It has been designed to give them all the information they need to know;



* Who you are
* What to expect from the research session
* What you'd like them to do (schedule an interview, sign the consent form, fill out the incentive form)
* Who will run the research session

There is a different pattern (called: Emailing someone to take part or register interest in research) to use if you are contacting users for the first time and they haven't opted-in/filled out a screener yet.


## How it works



* This pattern should give potential participants the information they need to; book in, complete a consent form & claim their incentive
* Choose the hierarchy based on participants e.g. is time important to include in a subject heading or incentives or something else?
* If there is a limited window of time to conduct the research in you may want to add that to the subject heading to inform users early on
* You should consider how you are going to prompt participants near to the day/time of the session

Known problems



* We have seen our paper.studio emails sometimes going into spam folders.

Research on the pattern



* Paper branding research - March 2021 - Harry Worsnop
* University of Sheffield Discovery - March 2021 - Rachael Tunnard and Harry Worsnop

If you use this pattern in the future please consider



* We don't know what the best language is when describing the money we are paying for taking part e.g. do we call it an 'incentive', 'compensation, or a 'thank you for you time' or something else?
* We need to test whether it's better for emails like this to be received from a Paper email address or from a client email address?

Things you will need



* A calendly booking link (or another booking tool). Please consider the data security issues that may arise from this choice.
* A consent form link
* An incentive form link


## Feedback

We’re grateful for any [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdQZa4pjPVUgcIEtStiH2jO4ByKhWHKyml7rz4B3xxBG7txKg/viewform) you can give us on this pattern or our pattern library.
